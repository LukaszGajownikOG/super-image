# Cascading Residual Network (CARN)

## Overview

The CARN model proposes an architecture that implements a cascading mechanism upon a residual network for accurate and lightweight image super-resolution.

This model also applies the balanced attention (BAM) method invented by [Wang et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07566) to further improve the results.

It was introduced in the paper [Fast, Accurate, and Lightweight Super-Resolution with Cascading Residual Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08664) by Ahn et al. (2018) and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/nmhkahn/CARN-pytorch).
