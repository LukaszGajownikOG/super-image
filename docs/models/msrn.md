# Multi-scale Residual Network for Image Super-Resolution (MSRN)

## Overview

The MSRN model proposes a feature extraction structure called the multi-scale residual block. This module can "adaptively detect image features at different scales" and "exploit the potential features of the image".

This model also applies the balanced attention (BAM) method invented by [Wang et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07566) to further improve the results.

It was introduced in the paper [Multi-scale Residual Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Juncheng_Li_Multi-scale_Residual_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.html) by Li et al. (2018) and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/MIVRC/MSRN-PyTorch).
