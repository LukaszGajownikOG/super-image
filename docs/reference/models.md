# Models

The base class [PreTrainedModel](#pretrainedmodel) implements the common methods for loading/saving a model either from a local file or directory, or from a pretrained model configuration provided by the library (downloaded from [HuggingFace's Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=super-image)).
